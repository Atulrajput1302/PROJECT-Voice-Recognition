Sound is a form of energy It can propagate through a medium like air
Sound wave is a pressure perturbation in the medium through which
sound travels

The pressure of travelling sound energy alternately causes
compression and rarefaction

Number of compressions and rarefactions of the molecules of the
medium ( air) per unit of time is described as frequency of that
sound

Expressed in Hertz ( is equal to the number of cycles per second
